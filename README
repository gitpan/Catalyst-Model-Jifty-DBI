SYNOPSIS
      $c->model('Jifty')->class('User')->load_by_cols(id=>1);

    This is a simple interface to the Jifty::DBI module. It's a convenient
    way to use it from your Catalyst Application.

CONFIG
  schema_base
    The namespace to look for record definitions in. the record method uses
    this to find your module.

  db
    This should be a hashref taking connection parameters. See the
    Jifty::DBI::Handle documentation for more information about the
    parameters it takes.

METHODS
  new
    Constructor. Sets up your Catalyst Model class and creates the handle.

  record
    Accessor to get a handle on your jifty record. Takes a record name, and
    creates a new instance of it based on the schema_base and the handle.

  handle
    This represents your Jifty::DBI::Handle instance. You can use it
    directly, or get it passed to your jifty record by using the "class"
    method.
